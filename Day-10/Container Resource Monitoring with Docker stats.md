**Understanding** docker stats

The docker stats command provides a real-time stream of resource usage statistics for containers. When executed, it displays the following key metrics:

| **Metric**         | **Description** |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **CPU Usage (%)**  | Percentage of total CPU resources used by the container. Can exceed 100% in multi-core systems. |
| **Memory Usage / Limit** | The actual memory being used vs. the maximum memory allocated for the container (if set). |
| **Memory Percentage (%)** | Memory usage relative to its limit. **Formula:** `(MEM USAGE / MEM LIMIT) * 100`. |
| **Network Traffic (NET I/O)** | Amount of data **received (RX) and transmitted (TX)** by the container. Helps detect spikes and bottlenecks. |
| **Block I/O (Disk Read/Write Operations)** | Shows disk activity in terms of **bytes read and written**. Useful for identifying excessive logging or database-intensive workloads. |
| **PIDs (Number of Processes)** | Displays the **number of active processes** inside the container. Can help detect process leaks or inefficiencies. |

**How to Use** docker stats

The docker stats command can be used in different ways:

**1. Monitor all running containers**

```sh
docker stats
```

Example Output:

```sh
CONTAINER ID   NAME       CPU %   MEM USAGE / LIMIT    MEM %   NET I/O     BLOCK I/O    PIDS
d3f1e22e0a11   web_app    2.56%   128MiB / 1GiB       12.5%    10kB / 5kB  2MB / 1MB    4
b6a9c91a9c12   db_server  1.78%   256MiB / 2GiB       12.8%    20kB / 10kB 4MB / 2MB    10
```

**2. Monitor a specific container**

```sh
docker stats <container_id_or_name>
```

Example:

```sh
docker stats web_app
```

**3. Display output in a custom format**

To extract specific fields using --format:

```sh
docker stats --format "table {{.Name}}\t{{.CPUPerc}}\t{{.MemUsage}}"
```

Example Output:

```sh
NAME       CPU %   MEM USAGE
web_app    2.56%   128MiB / 1GiB
db_server  1.78%   256MiB / 2GiB
```

**Analyzing** docker stats **Output**

The docker stats output provides insights into container performance, helping to diagnose issues and optimize resource allocation.

**1. CPU % (CPU Usage)**

‚Ä¢	Indicates the **percentage of total CPU resources** utilized by the container.

‚Ä¢	On multi-core systems, values can exceed 100% (e.g., **200% means two full cores** being used).

**Interpreting CPU Usage Levels**

‚úÖ **<10%** ‚Üí Low usage, mostly idle
‚ö†Ô∏è **10-50%** ‚Üí Moderate usage, typical for many workloads
üö® >80%‚Üí High CPU usage, potential bottleneck
  
üí° **Limit CPU usage for a container to prevent excessive resource consumption**:

```sh
docker run --cpus="1.5" your_container
```

---

**2. MEM USAGE / LIMIT (Memory Usage and Limits)**

‚Ä¢	**MEM USAGE** ‚Üí Actual memory used by the container.

‚Ä¢	**MEM LIMIT** ‚Üí Maximum memory allocated to the container (if defined). If not set, it shows the **total host memory**.

---

**3. MEM % (Memory Percentage Used)**

‚Ä¢	Represents **memory consumption relative to its limit.**

**‚Ä¢	Formula:**

```sh
‚Ä¢	Memory % = (MEM USAGE / MEM LIMIT) * 100
```

**Interpreting Memory Usage Levels**

‚úÖ **<50%** ‚Üí Optimal usage
‚ö†Ô∏è **50-80%** ‚Üí Monitor closely
üö® **>80%** ‚Üí Risk of Out of Memory (OOM) errors

---

**4. NET I/O (Network Traffic)**

‚Ä¢	Displays the **amount of data received (RX) and transmitted (TX)** by the container.

‚Ä¢	Helps detect unexpected **traffic spikes or bottlenecks**.

**Interpreting Network Traffic**

‚úÖ **Low network activity?** The application might be idle.
‚ö†Ô∏è **High network I/O?** Investigate excessive data transfer or potential data leaks.

üí° **Inspect network traffic inside a container using** tcpdump:

```sh
docker exec -it <container_id> tcpdump -i eth0
```

---

**5. BLOCK I/O (Disk Read/Write Operations)**

**‚Ä¢	First value:** Data read from disk.

**‚Ä¢	Second value:** Data written to disk.

**Interpreting Disk I/O Levels**

‚úÖ **<10MB** ‚Üí Expected for lightweight apps
‚ö†Ô∏è **10MB - 500MB** ‚Üí Moderate, typical for logging or caching
üö® **500MB - 5GB** ‚Üí High, likely due to frequent file operations or active databases
üî• **>5GB ‚Üí Excessive!** May indicate inefficient logging, batch jobs, or heavy writes

üí° **Optimizing High Disk I/O:**

**‚Ä¢	Reduce excessive logging:**

```sh
docker run --log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=3 my_container
```

**‚Ä¢	Optimize database-heavy applications:**

o	Implement **caching** (e.g., Redis).

o	Optimize **query performance.**

---

**6. PIDS (Number of Active Processes in the Container)**

‚Ä¢	Shows the **number of running processes inside the container.**

**Interpreting Process Counts**

‚úÖ **1-10** ‚Üí Simple applications
‚ö†Ô∏è **10-50** ‚Üí Moderate complexity
üö® **>50** ‚Üí Possible process leaks

üí° **Limit the number of processes in a container to prevent resource exhaustion:**

```sh
docker run --pids-limit=50 your_container
```

---

**Monitoring Specific Containers**

By default, docker stats shows resource usage for **all running containers.**

To monitor a **specific container:**

```sh
docker stats <container_id_or_name>
```

To filter containers by **name pattern:**

```sh
docker stats --filter "name=techops-*"
```

**Use Cases: Real-World Scenarios**

**1. Troubleshooting High Resource Utilization**

When a container is consuming high CPU or memory, use docker stats to identify the issue and take corrective actions like scaling resources or restarting the container.

**2. Capacity Planning**

By monitoring docker stats, DevOps teams can determine if resources are over- or under-utilized and adjust configurations accordingly.

**3. Load Testing and Benchmarking**

Use docker stats to analyze container behavior under load tests to ensure optimal performance before deploying to production.

**4. Identifying Memory Leaks**

If memory usage continuously increases over time, docker stats can help identify memory leaks in applications running inside containers.

**5. Ensuring Network Stability**

Monitor network traffic to ensure containers communicate efficiently, and detect unusual spikes that may indicate security threats.

---

**Automating Monitoring**

To automate monitoring, use a simple Bash script to log container statistics.

**Example: Log** docker stats **Output to a File**

```sh
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
    docker stats --no-stream >> /var/log/docker_stats.log
    sleep 60  # Capture stats every 60 seconds
done
```

Run the script in the background:

```sh
nohup ./monitor_docker_stats.sh &
```

**Integrating with Prometheus and Grafana**

For advanced monitoring, consider using **Prometheus** to scrape container metrics and visualize them using **Grafana.**

‚Ä¢	Install cAdvisor:

```sh
docker run -d --name=cadvisor \
  --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
  --volume=/var/run:/var/run:ro \
  --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
  --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
  --publish=8080:8080 \
  google/cadvisor:latest
```

‚Ä¢	Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from cAdvisor.

**Comparison with Other Monitoring Tools**

| **Tool**             | **Features** |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **`docker stats`**   | Basic real-time monitoring for **CPU, memory, network, and disk usage**. |
| **cAdvisor**         | Detailed container monitoring with **historical metrics, storage tracking, and per-process stats**. |
| **Prometheus + Grafana** | Advanced monitoring with **time-series data, visualization, and alerting** for containerized environments. |
| **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** | Centralized **logging and monitoring** with powerful search and visualization capabilities. |

For production environments, docker stats is a great starting point, but tools like **Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK** provide better insights and historical data analysis.
