**Here are 50 Docker Interview Questions from basic to advanced along with their answers:**

What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers and system administrators to build, ship, and run applications in lightweight, portable containers. It simplifies application deployment by providing a consistent environment across development, testing, and production.

What is a Docker container?

A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

How is a Docker container different from a virtual machine?

Docker containers share the host OS kernel and are lightweight compared to virtual machines, which include a full OS. Containers start faster and use fewer resources.

What is a Docker image?

A Docker image is a read-only template that contains the application code, dependencies, and instructions to create a Docker container.

What is the difference between a Docker image and a container?

An image is a static file that defines the environment and configuration for a container. A container is a running instance of an image.

What is Dockerfile?

A Dockerfile is a text file containing a series of instructions to build a Docker image.

What is the purpose of the docker run command?

The docker run command is used to create and start a container from a specified image.

What is the syntax to build an image from a Dockerfile?

docker build -t <image_name> .

What command is used to list running containers?

docker ps

How to stop a running container?

docker stop <container_id>

What is the command to remove a Docker container?

docker rm <container_id>

How do you remove an image in Docker?

docker rmi <image_id>

How can you check Docker logs of a container?

docker logs <container_id>

What is a Docker volume?

A Docker volume is a mechanism for persisting data generated by a container. Volumes allow data to be stored outside the container's filesystem.

How do you create a volume in Docker?

docker volume create <volume_name>

What command is used to enter an interactive shell inside a running container?

docker exec -it <container_id> bash

How do you list all Docker networks?

docker network ls

What is the default network mode in Docker?

bridge.

How do you check Docker version installed on your system?

docker --version

How do you run a container in detached mode?

docker run -d <image_name>

How do you restart a Docker container?

docker restart <container_id>

What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Dockerfile?

CMD provides default arguments for the container and can be overridden. ENTRYPOINT defines the main executable for the container and is less likely to be overridden.

How do you inspect details of a container?

docker inspect <container_id>

What is the use of the .dockerignore file?

The .dockerignore file excludes specified files and directories from being copied into the Docker image during the build process.

What is the purpose of the docker-compose tool?

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications using a docker-compose.yml file.

How do you scale containers using Docker Compose?

docker-compose up --scale <service_name>=3

What is the difference between a bind mount and a volume?

Bind mounts link a host directory to a container. Volumes are managed by Docker and are more suitable for containerized environments.

How do you pass environment variables to a Docker container?

-e flag: docker run -e VAR_NAME=value <image_name>

What is a multi-stage build in Docker?

A multi-stage build allows creating smaller and more efficient images by copying only the necessary artifacts from intermediate stages to the final stage.

How do you copy files from a running Docker container to the host?

docker cp <container_id>:/path/to/file /host/path

How do you set resource limits for a container?

Using flags such as --memory and --cpu in the docker run command.

What are Docker namespaces?

Namespaces provide isolation for containers, including process isolation (PID), network isolation, and file system isolation.

What is Docker Swarm?

Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool, enabling the management of a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system.

What is a Docker Registry?

A Docker Registry is a repository for storing and distributing Docker images. Examples include Docker Hub and private registries.

How do you push an image to Docker Hub?

docker push <username>/<image_name>:<tag>

What is the difference between docker stop and docker kill?

docker stop sends a SIGTERM signal to gracefully stop a container. docker kill sends a SIGKILL signal, forcefully stopping it.

How do you expose a port while running a container?

docker run -p 8080:80 <image_name>

How can you configure a container to restart automatically?

Use the --restart option with docker run (e.g., --restart=always).

What is the purpose of the docker prune command?

The docker prune command removes unused Docker objects such as stopped containers, dangling images, and unused networks.

23.	What is an overlay network in Docker?
24.	
An overlay network allows containers running on different hosts to communicate securely as if they were on the same network.

How do you secure Docker containers?

o	Use minimal base images.
o	Keep Docker and images updated.
o	Run containers as non-root users.
o	Use Docker secrets for sensitive data.
o	Limit container capabilities with security options.

What is the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?

Docker is a containerization platform, while Kubernetes is an orchestration platform for managing containers, including scaling, load balancing, and deployment.

How can you debug a failed Docker build?

Use the --progress=plain and --no-cache options with docker build to get detailed output and bypass cached layers.

What are Docker storage drivers?

Storage drivers manage how images and containers store and access data on the host system. Common drivers include overlay2, AUFS, and btrfs.

What is the significance of the HEALTHCHECK instruction in Dockerfile?

The HEALTHCHECK instruction defines how Docker checks the health of a container, allowing it to mark a container as healthy or unhealthy.

How do you deploy a containerized application in production?

Use orchestration tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or cloud-native services such as AWS ECS/EKS.

What are Docker secrets, and how do they work?

Docker secrets securely store and manage sensitive information such as passwords and API keys, accessible only to authorized containers.

What is BuildKit in Docker?

BuildKit is a feature in Docker that speeds up builds, enables parallel execution, and supports caching and advanced features like multi-stage builds.

How does Docker ensure isolation between containers?

Docker uses Linux kernel features such as namespaces for isolation and cgroups for resource allocation.

What are the best practices for writing a Dockerfile?

o	Use small base images.
o	Leverage multi-stage builds.
o	Avoid using latest tag for images.
o	Minimize the number of layers.
o	Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files.
o	Specify a non-root user.
